# Outcome

So many possibilities to transfer your learning achievements into some <u>___visible___</u> outcome!

<div style="text-align: center">
```mermaid {scale: 0.9}
mindmap
  outcome
    work
        project contribution
        coaching colleagues
        general environmental improvements
    presentation
        conference
        bar camp
        meetup
    write an article
        public blog post
        personal diary
    open source
        publish @ GitHub
```
</div>

By choosing <u>__at least one__</u> option for making it visible (to others), you increase your own engagement!
